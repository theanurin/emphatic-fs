# Etymology #
Why is the project called Emphatic, I hear you ask. Well, when I was
thinking about names, I started by considering variations of the FAT
acronym, such as adding my own initials. However, MSFAT has rather obvious
trademark issues, so I decided not to go with that one. Emphatic is a
homophone of MFATIC, which I arrived at after dropping the 'S'. Now, enough
of this trivial line of enquiry!

Unless otherwise stated, all byte quantities, such as kB MB GB or TB, will
refer to their traditional values, ie. **powers of 1024**, not powers of
1000.
